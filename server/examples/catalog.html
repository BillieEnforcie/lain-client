It makes everything so simple that is ridiculous.<br/><br/>For example, let's make an "echo server" with the possibility to connect to multiple clients. We could use sockets and multiple threads to deal with it, but i prefer to use the unix philosophy and write my program thinking to be used with "socat", a program that redirects socket connection to another file descriptor/socket, in my case, the file descriptors will be the stdin and stdout of my program, so my server program will be literally this:<br/>
                     <pre><code class="hljs cpp">C<br/><br/><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-meta-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-meta-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span><br/><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-meta-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-meta-string">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span></span><br/><br/><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span><br/><span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> argc, <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> *argv[])</span><br/></span>{<br/>        <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> buffer[<span class="hljs-number">256</span>];<br/>        <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(fgets(buffer, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">256</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">stdin</span>) != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>) {<br/>                <span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"echo: %s\n"</span>, buffer);<br/>                fflush(<span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span>);<br/>        }<br/>} </code></pre>
                     <br/>And the command to execute this server will be:<br/><br/>
                     <pre><code class="hljs bnf">Bash Script<br/>socat TCP-LISTEN:<span class="hljs-attribute">&lt;port&gt;</span>,fork EXEC:<span class="hljs-attribute">&lt;program_location&gt;</span> </code></pre>
                     <br/>For every connection, the socat will fork and execute an instance of my program with the standard file descriptors redirecting to socket, so every write to stdout, with fflush to make sure that will be written, will be send to the connected socket and every data the client sends can be read by reading to stdin. With more complex stuff, we could use what Unix provide to us: Message Queues, Semaphores and Shared Memory, so a program doesn't need to "exist" to save some stuff in RAM or have coordination of write process (by using SysV Semaphores). Unix by itself is a excellent tool, and have lot's of minimal programs that do the dirty job for us, but why do we need to reinvent it by using programs like Kafka and Docker (we could implement CPU servers from Plan9, instead of multiple VMs) or even make an monolithic program in some idiotic strange language, like Java or Python? C itself have lot's of really useful functions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library</a>), and is a very clean high level language (yes, it's a high level language, words of Ken Thompson). <br/>Why do we need to suffer at work when there are better and clean executable tools for us to use?

                     a well designed language needs to do 2 things:<br/>- maximize hardware utilization (performance)<br/>- make the programmer's work easier (productivity)<br/><br/>the core assumptions behind functional programming make it much worse at these 2 metrics.<br/>for example the assumption that always immutable is a good thing - it makes it hard for the programmer to express even trivial things (productivity) and harder for the compiler to optimize the code (performance).<br/><br/>therefore at a fundamental level functional programming is a really bad design, and that's reflected by nobody using it in the real world.

The only /λ/-related take would be doing data science on historical data, but forecasting is partly just palm reading done by white collars if you ask me.<br/><br/>What do lainons think about the web3 paradigm, DeFi and DApps in general? Looks like there's plenty of room for being creative.<br/><br/>I am trying to dive into it all but don't know where to start.

                     Vim, with its modal editing style and quick, ergonomic key commands, brings extremely efficient text editing to the masses even today. However, extensibility and customization rely on custom languages, hacky installation methods, and decades of soykaff'd cruft.<br/><br/>Emacs, with its infinite customization and configuration, brings powerful advanced features to the table.  However, it too has disadvantages: decades of cruft, to be sure, but feature creep has taken its toll with storage size (easily into the hundreds of megabytes for a "lightweight" emacs installation) and speed.<br/><br/>It is time to install a new editor: *your* editor.<br/><a href="https://your-editor.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://your-editor.org/</a><br/><br/>in;b4<br/><span class="quote">&gt;Why yet another editor? Don't we have enough of those?</span><br/>This one, written in C to be lightweight and performant, includes infinite customizability as a first-class feature. That's why it's *yours*-- you make the editor do what you want it to. With a growing number of plugins, a tiny easy-to-understand core, and a simple C API for creating your own custom plugins, `yed` features all you could ever want in an editor:<br/>1. Per-directory configuration files.<br/>2. Compiled, easy-to-write plugins.<br/>3. Easy style configuration.<br/>4. Powerful, advanced features, but *only* if you want them.<br/>5. Multiple, layer-able frames (e.g. pulling up a `man` page in a frame above the primary one)<br/>6. Dynamic key bindings (including sequences).<br/>7. Crazy-fast startup times: tens of milliseconds, even with 50+ plugins (depends on filesize, of course).<br/>8. Ability to have entire user interfaces built atop buffers and frames.<br/>9. Easy integration with standard UNIX tools.<br/>10. No dependencies. All you need is a C compiler.<br/><br/>If you want to chat about `yed`, join our Discord server: you can join it via a link in the User Guide.

                     Hey Lainons, I've been writing C#soykaf for my dayjob for the last couple of years while still trying to study more interesting languages (CL, racket, haskell) and concepts like compiler design, combinatorial logic, graphics programming in my spare time. Feeling more than a little burnt out at this point. Feel like the dayjob snuffed out the passionate interest I had in CS/mathematics. There's so little time to go as deep as I want to.<br/><br/>How do you find motivation to continue working on hobby projects, studying math, studying the actual "science" behind "computer science"? How do you make the time for it? From where do you pull inspiration from when you just want to quit?

                     This is the thread for those of us who enjoy the machine codes, the assembler languages, and the rest of the lower levels our machines have.  If you have any routines, techniques, tools, or anything else related to this wide topic, do post it in here.<br/><br/>On that note, let this also be a thread for discussion of machine preferences.  To encourage discussion, here are some questions:<br/><br/>Do you think binary machines are the best or trinary or decimal or something else?<br/>Are you more inclined towards the hardware itself and prefer machines that can be specialized?<br/>What do you like most about the lower levels of your machines?  What do you tend to do with it?<br/>Do you prefer virtual machines over a more general hardware bedrock?<br/><br/>In light of recent events, let's try to compile resources related to this topic as well, considering that very specific information can already be hard to find at times.

                     Other thread hit its bump limit<br/><br/>"Using functions, rather than loops and assignment statements, to express algorithms changes everything. First of all, an algorithm expressed as a function is composed of other, more basic functions that can be studied separately and reused in other algorithms. For instance, a sorting algorithm may be specified in terms of building a tree of some kind and then flattening it in some way. Functions that build trees can be studied separately from functions that consume trees. Furthermore, the properties of each of these basic functions and their relationship to others can be captured with simple equational properties. As a result, one can talk and reason about the ‘deep’ structure of an algorithm in a way that is not easily possible with imperative code. To be sure, one can reason formally about imperative programs by formulating their specifications in the predicate calculus, and using loop invariants to prove they are correct. But, and this is the nub, one cannot easily reason about the properties of an imperative program directly in terms of the language of its code. Consequently, books on formal program design have a quite different tone from those on algorithm design: they demand fluency in both the predicate calculus and the necessary imperative dictions. In contrast, many texts on algorithm design traditionally present algorithms with a step-by-step commentary, and use informally stated loop invariants to help one understand why the algorithm is correct.With a functional approach there are no longer two separate languages to think about, and one can happily calculate better versions of algorithms, or parts of algorithms, by the straightforward process of equational reasoning. That, perhaps, is the main contribution of this book."

                     Greetings. I'm a janny on another minor imageboard and I'm thinking of writing a new imageboard. I want to make this a serious alternative to lynxchan and the vichan derivatives (incl. lainchan) due to being dissatisfied with their architecture, maintainability and dated UX/UI.<br/><br/>I've been soliciting feedback from my fellow jannies and they told me to come here to ask you folks what you think, and I think I would like to include feedback from the greater alt-chan community as well.<br/><br/>What does /λ/ think of:<br/><br/>Architecture: Monolith vs Microservices<br/>Front end: SPA (ex: Angular, React) vs Server Side HTML templating<br/>Backend Language: Java, C#, Lisp, Rust, Golang, PHP, etc.<br/>Database: SQL vs NoSQL<br/><br/>My personal preference would be for something like Spring Boot+JPA although its boring, there are a huge number of people who know java anyway. Plus there are prebuilt solutions for common problems in many java libs.<br/><br/>Any suggestions?

                     Apart from purely recreational, educational or academic purposes, is there any case where beginning a new project in C, C++, etc. is the best choice?<br/><br/>Can a memory-managed language that eliminates the kind of security issues that plague C be almost as fast, for all intents and purposes?<br/><br/>Which languages do you think should (or shouldn't) replace C family languages for various fields (e.g. should OSs prefer a different language to performant graphics code)?<br/><br/>For those who claim C and C++ aren't obsolete, do you think they ever can be obsoleted?

                     Let's have a Zig thread. Post interesting stuff, show your projects or tell everyone what you love or hate about Zig.<br/><br/>For those not aware, the Zig programming language is a compiled general-purpose language that basically aims to be a replacement for the C programming language. It removes the bad parts of C, such as undefined behavior and the macro preprocessor, and adds modern programming features that help in writing robust, safe and reusable code while giving you the same control over memory allocations and code alignment that you get with C. It seamlessly integrates with C libraries and comes with its own standard library (which doesn't depend on libc).<br/><br/><a href="https://ziglang.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ziglang.org/</a><br/><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/</a><br/><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki</a>

                     I started learning webdev on my own around 2 months ago. I've learned what there is to know about javascript and have done some things with it, but I've never really liked it, so I started looking at other languages, which led me to learn Ruby, and I am really liking it! Why isn't Ruby more popular? Yeah, I know performance wise it's a bit slow, but the language itself just feels so much better to use than javascript!

                     This is the third thread for APL, K, J, and their related languages.  So far, every thread for these has died prematurely or, rather, been killed, but I believe they have a place here.  Here are some questions to start discussion:<br/>What were your first experiences with APL?<br/>What are your preferred methods for writing APL?<br/>What are your APL programs?<br/>What are your preferred implementations?

                     I am wondering why many of you here like to use programming languages that are "dead" or have been replaced, examples being C, Lisp and Haskell among others. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a language that isn't shoved in your place every time you log onto the wired I am a PHP and SQL developer myself but I do not understand why you continue to use these languages that have been replaced in my opinion. Is it for work? Is it to make yourself feel special? I am not trying to be rude but I see no reason to continue to use these languages for many use cases. What do you guys even do for projects? Hello World in 100 different Lisp dialects? I have an open mind so please help me understand. Excuse the poor English as well please.

                     This is a thread for discussing the Ada programming language.  There doesn't seem to be many Ada programmers here, but we'll see.<br/><br/>The Ada programming language was created for the United States Department of Defense in order to provide a reliable programming language to replace the many hundreds in use there at the time.  The specifications of what would be desired in this language went through several transformations, from Strawman to Woodenman to Tinman to Ironman; the end result was Ada, a very strongly-typed language designed to catch as many errors as possible at compilation and avoid many common classes of errors in order to help ensure program correctness, along with being designed for large groups to use and with explicit and strong support for concurrency and bending to the demands of other environments, languages, or hardware.<br/><br/>Unlike other programming languages, Ada has many different facilities that are not generally useful, but are necessary for certain classes of programs.  Lastly and despite all of this, Ada can be too powerful for the requirements of some and so both SPARK and the Ravenscar profile exist as subsets of Ada designed for more powerful verification and testing of programs.<br/><br/>For those of you interested, what do you use Ada for?  Why do you use Ada?  Which facilities of Ada do you find yourself using the most or appreciating the presence of?  What tools do you use for writing your Ada programs?

                     Hey guys.  I'm trying to generate multiple addresses on the Binance Smart Chain Network using this tool.  <br/><br/><a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth-accounts.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth-accounts.html</a><br/><br/>I need to generate 2200 addresses and then transfer 5000 tokens to each address.  This is for a raffle that is going to be taking place very soon in which each 5000 tokens qualify as an entry but needs to be in a separate wallet.  <br/><br/><strong>After the raffle ends I will want to be able to recall those tokens back to the main sending wallet</strong>, instead of sending all 2200 back manually one by one.  I think this tool is able to accomplish that exactly but I am not sure how to use it?  Where do I start?  Your enlightenment is appreciated

                     I've been programming for a while and know quite a bit now, but I have trouble coming up with ideas for projects. Sometimes, I'll even be in the middle of the project and then question why I started it in the first place and then give up. Does anyone have similar issues? If so, how do you deal with this?

                     I'm a fool. Anything more complicated than a toy project makes my eyes glaze over. What interesting approaches are there (from a PLT perspective) to improving readability? I'm curious of some more esoteric ideas that lain might've heard of since structured programming, modules, DSLs, pure FP, etc. are all old hat by now.<br/><br/>One aspect of readability in particular that has been on my mind is how debug statements have the same semantic weight as the core algorithm. Worse still, program flow or type signatures need to be changed to permit some of the more complex forms like error handling, statistics etc. More abstractly, there's a lot of cases where it's impossible to cleanly separate concerns because the only efficient implementation requires intertwining the logic.<br/><br/>Have there been any attempts at overcoming this? It's hard to think of something general that wouldn't be fragile or narrow like stream fusion.

                     I don't understand how it's possible for one-way encryption to be a thing. If a function isn't injective then different passwords would be hashed to the same string, making it insecure. If it is injective then it can be turned into a bijective function by restricting its codomain to its image and all bijective functions are invertible. How does something like sha256 work? Am I missing something really obvious?

                     I feel like the whole "windows" for visual and "terminal" for text is the wrong approach. The UI needs to be morphable, easy to change and adapt to my current use-case. Something similar to what Doug Engelbart showed in his famous demo. I feel like the Wolfram notebook is probably the closest thing to what I'm thinking about. A terminal that can inline graphics, while also feeling like a REPL. Does that make any sense? Maybe we need to bring Lisp Machines back.

                     I've been using Bootstrap CSS in my main project for a while now, but due to how big (~150 KiB) even the minified version is, and how generic it looks, I'm considering remaking everything using my own CSS. Learning things along the way, too.<br/><br/>I can't go all out and make it Lain-y though, since it's something meant for every kind of website to use and adjust to the liking of its users. So I'm afraid I'll spend a lot of time making what is effectively a Bootstrap clone without some of the smart design choices. I guess it would at least look more original, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>What does Lain think? Is there a better framework you'd recommend?

                     As a new follower of the 'gramming path I've been wary to fall into pitfalls that're oft warned of. These are: falling into the deceptive cycle of comfortably installing random libraries for even the most basic of functions, writing in C, and Rust. <br/><br/>But I wonder often where to go from here? I've been writing plenty of calculators, string sorters and beancounters but these're all really simple programs and not very fun to do. I also don't want to fall into the trap of soigramming and using an easy-to-use language that babies you until you only know how to npm install soykaf. Any advice?

                     Why does Java/C# get crapped on so hard here? Corporations like Netflix use spring stack java, even Google search OG version was written in Java + Python, tons of silicon valley + startup companies use Java, not to mention a thousand different non tech corporations using Java or C# for internal business applications. Hobbyists use Java and for "hackathons", not to mention half of all computer science departments in Universities use Java/C# (or C++).<br/><br/>Yet ask around here it's like Java was outdated in 1999. People have this weird image of "mainstream" languages like their idea of Java is stuck in 2005 or something, when Java apps were heavyweight, overengineered design-patternified goliaths. Meanwhile you can write a spring boot java app nowadays that literally requires zero xml (outside the pom file) because its all annotations now.<br/><br/>Do people just love to hate these languages because it's their day job? IMO the point of a language is to build something that works, and is maintainable and extendable by other people, and Java/C# does that. To the extent certain corps are moving away from Java its for patent/copyright reasons like Google. And what do they switch to? Other JVM languages like Kotlin/Scala/Groovy. On the MS side of things people seem pretty satisfied with C# and maybe F# if they're feeling edgy.<br/><br/>At the very least the JVM/CLR platforms are going to continue far far into the future, and not just on legacy projects but greenfield projects as well.<br/><br/>Even in a microservice environment java shops will probably just switch to quarkus+graalvm/micronaut/eclipse microprofile over depending if they're coming from a spring or "vanilla" JavaEE/J2EE background. <br/><br/>If a language powers a ton of major companies and websites isn't there something to be said about it? Isn't the proof in the pudding? As the creator of C++ said, "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.". The only major language I see coming to disrupt any of this is golang, and even that's low level enough that its more of a systems programming language than anything related to back end web dev.<br/><br/>Again, I just think much of the Java/C# hate here and on other /g/ boards is actually irrational and either born of ignorance of the state of modern Java/C# or devs seething about their day jobs. Again Java and C# are perfectly respectable choices along with other languages like JS/TS, golang, and python. <br/><br/>**P.S. Even if you are a functional programming cultist it makes no sense to like python but hate java because guido is far more opposed to FP than oracle.**

                     Hey lainons, I come with a question: has college/university level education truly helped you learn to program?<br/><br/>I'm on my second year of University studying Software Development, and while I love the subject and programming, I think the environment and way of teaching is so far from how I like to learn. Pre-recorded lectures we're to watch over at home, long long word documents with tasks that don't really go into the meat of the subject area, and overall are just completely unmotivating with how much googling you'll need to do to get your head wrapped around the task, and lecturers who don't check their emails, don't explain things in a way I can understand, and heavily accented so I'm needing to put overtime into hearing them. I don't know if it's because of COVID making getting us in to learn a soykafty time, me just being a lazy ass and not properly applying myself, or if university really isn't the learning environment for me. At this point I would only be doing it for the degree at the end of the road, because I don't feel I'm gonna really enjoy the course.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts? Do other lainons going to tertiary education during this COVID soykaf feel like learning is difficult? Are there any alternative routes you feel are good to look into?

                     Hi lainons, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit here but I need to vent somewhere about my problems. For the past 2 years or so I've been trying really hard to get into programming with no success. The only thing I learnt is how to write hello world in 5 languages or so and how to do basic arithmetic.<br/><span class="quote">&gt;Programming is not for everybody.</span><br/>I know, but I'm 100% sure that the day that I will have created something that I always wanted nothing can stop me anymore. Problem is that it's really hard to reach that stage currently. I've read tons of books but finished only about 5% of them simply because I got demotivated or found another source that is better,<br/><span class="quote">&gt;Turn off your internet if it's distracting you.</span><br/>Even this doesn't help. I usually walk out of my room after 4 lines or so and make a quick tour around my house to because I can't concentrate on the book.<br/><span class="quote">&gt;Don't readPDFs on your PC.</span><br/>I bought a physical copy of "Programming In The Advanced UNIX environment" and "A Book On C" in the hopes of not getting distracted but nothing changed.  I just keep shoving the books away whenever I don't feel like it anymore.<br/><span class="quote">&gt;It's too late for you. Get a different hobby.</span><br/>Impossible. The only talent I have is knowing how to use computers, I use Gentoo as my daily driver but when it comes to creating stuff myself I just can't. I struggled 4 months to make a torrent client with no results because I never got started.<br/>If there is still a single thing that can be done to help me out of my situation please let me know. I will try to read a little more but in 2 more hours it's time to go to bed meaning that I will have done literally nothing for an entire day again. Thanks in regard.

                     Too many lainons <span class="spoiler">including myself</span> want to improve their C but just don't find something enjoyable to use it for. I don't want to do project euler stuff, I want to build something that more practical. Maybe with some socket programming as well, as networking never fails to fascinate me.<br/>ITT we share ideas to practice (C) programming with a nice little project.

                     Do you consider programming an artistic creative exercise or a logical scientific exercise.<br/><br/>I have always thought of programming to be more artistic because, although writing working code is more logical work, but the real effort while writing code is writing good, well-documented code with a predictable structure and design which is much more artistic.

                     I am currently still in school but think ahead a little, and since uni will probably consume a lot of time on its own I plan on building a bunch of neat little projects to put on my github that would basically show a potential employer that I know programming.<br/>I am especially interested in data science and statistics,  security and network stuff.<br/>My current skill level is mediocre, I know python and C, at a pretty good level with the former and a beginner's level with the latter. I've also recently been getting into CTFs and have toyed with a bunch of libraries and technologies over the last years, but never had any idea good enough to put in a lot of dedication to build any larger project. The major reason for this is that I don't really find any motivation for doing something that has been done before in a better way, and most ideas I came across have already been built.<br/>I intend to major in physics and it would be very neat to find a job or at least a paid internship that would be at least somewhat related to the kind of work I might be getting after I have my degree (that is something related to the fields I mentioned before hopefully, I don't think I will ever be smart enough to get into a research position).<br/>Pic related mostly just contains rather boring or useless stuff, at least in my opinion, maybe you can get something out of it.

                     After spending some time on Amazon and Google looking for possible entry points, I come to you guys hoping you will be able to help me. Basically, after reading a bit about Namecoin and seeing it in action through Zeronet some time ago, I got an idea for a similar thing I want to try making (or for that matter just make my own soykafty version of Namecoin for practice). The problem is, when I tried looking online for material on how to develop blockchains, most of the material I found was either very rudimentary (poorly-documented helloworlds), only focusing on dapps and not making your own blockchains, paywalled, or discussed crypto from a business perspective in terms of trading and applications rather than development. Can anyone here recommend me material about blockchain and cryptocurrency development that's actually useful for a developer?<br/><br/>As an aside, I heard that this is something that you typically see infosecs deal with more than typical CS people, if that's the case then I should point out I'm only a CS person and have only very basic knowledge of cryptography concepts.<br/><br/>(pic unrelated, I wanted to post Lain but it said someone already posted the Lain I was trying to post)

If so, what cases do you think async does not belong?<br/><br/>I'll start off: my work has started using reactive programming a few months ago, and is still exploring proper micro-patterns for working in it. I like the FP aspect, however the library I've been using forces me to translate thrown exceptions into error values, and if I don't, the exception is no longer catchable in the entire reactive chain.

                     Do you think there are any declarative programming languages at the moment that are developed enough to be useful? <br/><br/>Declarative programming is a really fascinating subject, I just wish there was more research/development there. Prolog has been the number one in the field forever, but things like Sentient Lang and Mercury are able to do similar things while being a much newer and more featureful language. That being said, with a proper declarative language, there's no such thing as a feature ;)

Let's share your questions, accomplishments, tutorials and papers.<br/><br/>I am a total newbie in this area, but very excited one.<br/>My first question:<br/><br/>What framework would you recommend for someone who would like to create VST for DAWs?<br/><br/>I've tried IPlug2 today, it looks ok and has huge potential, but I am afraid that is's still too much "in development". For example out of 2 examples I tried on my Windows 10 one didn't worked and second work only as a standalone target. Building VST2/3 projects result in errors. Also, I would prefer developing on Linux.<br/><br/>I have tried JUCE some time ago, but I really didn't liked that's such a huge tool. Maybe I should give it more time.<br/><br/>Also, is there a chance to use only:<br/>1. imgui (or other GUI library, imgui would be cool as it's 3D-pipeline agnostic, so probably good for plugins). <br/>2. some DSP library<br/>3. some MIDI library<br/>4. probably some other libraries which I don't know about yet<br/><br/>This would be better than using huge undocumented frameworks, I can sacrifice all this nice looking knobs.                                                </div>

And I don't mean tutorials, I mean general interesting youtube channels, where people program or discuss some non-beginner problems<br/><br/>I realize, that it may sound absurd. But there are good explanatory channels for all kinds of stuff (nerdwriter for example), so why not for programming.<br/><br/>Few years ago, I've found channel where guy was just making small video games in Wiring or some similar kind of soykaf. But it was nicely done, focused on code and was somehow relaxational. I would like to find out something in this style, some kind of programming poetry, or programming jams.<br/><br/>PS: I know about computerphile and that is not what I mean.

                     I have an idea for an app and I must use weather data.<br/><br/>Every weather API I've searched so far has a freemium model that pretty much requires you to buy a subscription when your app hits a few users.<br/><br/>What is preventing me from just using browser data and just get weather data from google's search engine? I mean if you just google weather you can get your local weather data? Can't I use that and not buy any freemium APIs?

                     I didn't see a topic for the Github copilot in either lambda or omega board so here it is. <br/><br/>For those who didn't heard about this yet Github copilot is a AI powerd autocomplete tool that can create the whole functions based on a function name or commentary given by a programmer. As much as this still looks as a product that is driven by hype and marketing I can't seam to feel that in time if given enought resources could potentially be a real thing. Maybe I'm not worried that it will take my job but I am worried that it will change the way programmers work in the future. If for instance my job will be based on checking automatic ganerated code Github copilot makes and try to assess if it makes sense rather then create this code by myself then a programing job will lose a lot of appeal for me. <br/><br/> What do you think about this? Is this the futrue of programing? I really hope not.

                     Hi Lain, I do not post often so I do not know if this is the correct board to ask for advice.<br/><br/>I am graduating this year and I am unsure about the direction I should take. One is as a Technical Engineer<br/>at Google, sort of like a customer support for their cloud customers. I do not know why they contacted<br/>me for this position since I am not particularily good when dealing with people.<br/><br/>The other opportunity is on a medium sized company in Japan, in which I could do more programming, which is<br/>what I am most interested in. The catch is that due to travel restrictions this would happen until next year,<br/>so I would have some free time after I finish school.<br/><br/>So I guess I am split between this, working at a big tech company which pays well (it would help, since in my country the salaries are very low),<br/>on a position i am not very passionate about, or working on a smaller company which pays less but I get to program more.<br/><br/>Does any lainon has any experience working on big tech companies?<br/><br/>Also, if I get some free time after school I am thinking about contributing to some open source projects. IPFS caught my eye, but what does<br/>lain think about decentralised applications and protocols? Do you think they have a potential as a future replacement of HTTP and potential career?

It is literally a giant math formula that takes a pixel on the screen and a moment in time, then calculates the color of the pixel.<br/>f(x,y,t) = [r,g,b]<br/>So... <br/>Could you possibly use this technique along with Tupper's formula from computer graphics (which returns a Boolean 1 or 0 from a grid) to also calculate collision?<br/>And then add a player x and y to our formula.<br/>f(x,y,t,playerX,playerY) = (r,g,b)<br/>To create an entirely ray traced video game that all contained into a single math formula?<br/>So a god with infinite time could calculate and play this game with pen and pencil.<br/><br/>For example: <br/>Let the user hold down a button to increase or decrease their x or y.<br/>Modulo their x and y and pass them to Tupper's formula.<br/>If the formula returns a 1, a collision occurred.<br/>Negate the 1 by (1 - Tuppers(x,y)) which gives us a 0<br/>Multiply this quantity by the vector we are adding to the players velocity.<br/><br/>1 keeps the velocity, 0 cancels it out and stops the player thus we have collision while preserving branchless programming?<br/>Flaw in my logic?

                     Hi lainons, I'm trying to design an algorithm for finding the least amount of lines to intersect a number of circles (given by radius and center coordinates) in 2d space. I'm fairly certain the problem is NP-hard, and I'm trying to have it run in O(n^2) as an upper limit. I came up with the following algorithm:<br/><br/>1. generate 10 lines for each circle, with random distances from the center (but still intersecting)<br/>2. Sort the lines by number of circles intersected<br/>3. iterate over the sorted list, marking all intersected circles and removing a line when no new circles are intersected<br/><br/>Any suggestions/improvements?<br/><br/>I posted this on /g/ the other day and now I'd like some help regarding the dimensionality reduction. An anon suggested applying ISOMAP to go from (x, y, radius) to (radius, number of lines) but I'm not quite sure how I would go about this, and then how to retrieve the specific lines I'm going for... <br/><br/>I'm a total idiot regarding stuff like this, so any help is appreciated!

                     Irasutoya is a Japanese stock photo website, using a cute, cartoon style for their photos.<br/>I am a big fan of Irasutoya.<br/>I would like to download the whole entire website.<br/>I have tried this before, via the 'wget' program, on a third party search feature for the website, to no success.<br/>The website indexes all of it's files by the appropriate categories (i.e. <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.irasutoya.com/2012</a> (you could also select the year the photo was published, like I've done here))<br/>The website indexes it's photos by giving a grid of 8x3 of low quality thumbnails, and once a photo is clicked it takes the visitor to another page with another low quality thumbnail and the photo's description, which needs to be clicked on to attain the high quality version of the file.<br/>This then takes the user to a random blogspot domain, with a seemingly random page accessed on the blogspot website.<br/>To display more photos for the chosen category, one needs to click on the "次のページ" button.<br/>This is where my problem lies; I lack the programming skills to scrape this website -- this seems too complex of a procedure for a script-kiddie like me to solve, even with online "guides", due to how one comes about the high quality image.<br/><br/><span class="spoiler">What does Lain <strong>personally</strong> suggest?</span>

                     Where can I find programming buddies? I saw this trend on Reddit where programmers would look for others that are learning about the same technology in order to share knowledge and stay motivated. Only problem was that most of them were only interested in communication through Discord or similar proprietary platforms.<br/>Texting is fine but I also like to have a VC from time to time. I tried our Mumble server but most of the time there are no more than 1 or2 members and all of them are AFK.<br/><br/>If anybody is interested in learning C, Haskell or Go with me I will leave my contact details below.<br/>Mumble: mikoto-chan on lainchan.org<br/>Matrix: avdb:midov.pl<br/>IRC: mikoto-chan on Freenode<br/>XMPP: avdb:yax.im

                     Hey lain, I was homeless three years ago as a 20 yo (just when I discovered programming, I started going at it non-stop and lost my job, lost all connection with parents and all little friends I have). This place influenced me a lot and this is where I spent my time sleeping in a tent in a small forested area near a mall and in a homeless shelter full of druggies.<br/>Now I have a 100k+ job working on cryptography, I'm a (relatively) well-known cryptographer in my field. I'm working on LWE now and I will fight the good fight until it's done.<br/><br/>Thank you for everything.<br/><br/>/blog

                     Does lain exercise his programming skills by solving programming riddles and/or doing competitive programming?<br/>This is a thread for all things related to it, I got hooked on codewars.com three days ago and I am hyped, I suck at the optimization challenges for now and my code always times out but I am learning and I think its a great way to practice some C programming. I try to solve a problem, learn a lot of stuff along the way and after I finish I see what people who know their stuff are doing to solve the problem. This way I learn doing stuff on my own as well as best practice.<br/>Didn't even read pdf related but I thought it would be more useful than a random pic.

                     For a while I've been one of those blockheads that just writes everything in python, but recently I've been taking the time to actually learn proper shell scripting (plus awk and sed), and I've found that it's a much better choice for 90% of my general purpose scripting. I'm curious about the remaining 10%.<br/><br/>Call it the "hash table threshold" i.e. when whatever you're doing could really stand to benefit from proper data structures. For example: dealing with a complicated web API, lexical file parsing, doing anything with a substantial runtime state. This is of course different for everyone so I'd like to know where <em>your</em> hash table threshold is and what language you tend to choose when you reach it.<br/><br/>The obvious answer is "python" but I'm particularly interested in thoughtful alternatives, preferably ones that act more "UNIXy" than python.<br/><br/><span class="spoiler">this is also your chance to inform me on perl</span>

                     Drew Devault, the programmer behind Sway, wlroots and sourcehut is working on a new systems programming language.<br/><span class="quote"><br/>&gt;The language is pretty small — we have a mostly complete specification which clocks in at 60 pages.</span><br/><span class="quote"><br/>&gt;It has manual memory management, no runtime, and it uses a superset of the C ABI, making it easy to link with libraries and C code. It should be suitable almost anywhere C is useful: compilers, system utilities, operating systems, network servers and clients, and so on.</span><br/><span class="quote"><br/>&gt;We could compare our language to many other languages, but let’s start with how it compares to C:</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;More robust error handling via tagged unions</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Improved, Unicode-aware string support</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Memory safe array, slice, and pointer types (and unsafe versions, if needed)</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Direct compatibility with the C ABI for trivial C interop</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;A simpler, context-free, expression-oriented syntax</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;A standard library free of the constraints of POSIX or the C standard</span><br/><span class="quote"><br/>&gt;We have a number of focus areas for standard library development. [...] The focus areas we’re looking into now are:</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Algorithms, Cryptography, Date &amp; time support, Debugging tools, Formats &amp; encodings, xxxx language support, Networking, Platform support, String manipulation &amp; Unix support</span><br/><br/><a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/03/19/A-new-systems-language.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drewdevault.com/2021/03/19/A-new-systems-language.html</a><br/><br/>From what I've seen him talking on fedi I think it's going to be Golang but with optional unsafe pointers and RAII instead of garbage collection. It will be dynamically linked for sure. Coroutines will be obviously implemented as libraries and not as first class citizens.<br/>I don't know if it's going to have it's own build chain and package manager, probably not, it's probably going to be build system agnostic.<br/><br/>I think it might get some users from Rust, but Rust has the Rust book which a lot of people seem to think is a good introduction to systems programming. Rust also is a very different language so it's hard to tell even though the target "market" is the same.<br/><br/>The ABI is a superset of the C ABI so it's a good candidate for C projects that don't want to use C++, Golang or Rust.

                     Hey guys, do you guys know of any alternatives to MockFlow besides just your good ol' pen and paper? I really like to plan ahead the different designs I want to do for my UIs but I just MockFlow to be very expensive,  though very complete and useful. What do you guys think?

                     you what's up gamers I need input on how you would want a build tool to work for you<br/>for whatever language you want to support<br/>(e.g. do you want rigid project structure enforcement? integration within already existing language ecosystems? editor integrations? verbosity of information it gives you? etc.) because I hate pretty much every build tool(ing) and ecosystem. To get it out of the way now: I'm not going to be hosting anything (i.e. no package servers or remote building, except if they're self-hosted).

                     We have a Programming Employment thread but not a thread that discusses whether one should go to university/college to succeed.<br/><br/>I have autism spectrum disorder and am an autodidact meaning that I can easily discipline myself to learn without any supervision, the only thing in my way right now is scheduling my time properly with school. I'd hate following a schedule, having to attend lectures with a lot of unfamiliar people and living in a small dorm room far away from home.<br/><br/>The problem with autodidacts is that I live in West-Europe where all CS jobs require a degree. Since I'm familiar with programming already I was wondering if I'm better off studying mathematics (which by itself is a useless degree according to my math teacher unless you know how to apply it to real-world problems) or another science-related subject.

                     I hate how JS is used today. I hate that it's the language for doing things inside of web pages. The academia industry wrongly teaching soykafloads of kids how and when to used JS has resulted in a bloated, decaying and insecure Web. Nowadays you almost need a low end gaming PC to browse the modern Web, if you're browsing anything outside of cool websites made by competent computer nerds, that is.<br/>But would it be worth it for me to learn JS if only to partake in things not made for the Web at all? JS is THE language of making programs inside Web pages, but there's a couple niches where it actually seems fun.<br/>One is Espruino boards. I could take a long time to explain what a Espruino board is, but some one will ask "Isn't that just a Javascript Arduino?" and well, almost yeah. There are some differences but yeah. A Espruino is a Javascript Arduino board. It seems pretty cool to me, the pages on their website with example projects have Espruino boards doing really cool things, and I'd probably spend less time pulling my hair out if I tried to do the same things in C instead of JS.<br/>The other is Screeps, a MMO game where you program robots, but you program them with real code. It's your actual code out there running robots to fight other peoples robots. There's even an Android client on Fdroid for Screeps. It seems really fun.<br/><br/>So do you think would it be worth it for me to learn  JS when I absolutely loathe it's main and most used purpose, and only want to use it for a couple niche things?

                     Do you guys like flight simulators?  I started working on one today in g3n, a go graphics library pic not related.  There's not a lot of open source stuff in this area, at least at a glance.  Trade secrets I guess.  <br/><br/>Any of you guys do real-time aerodynamics stuff?  Trying to understand how angle of attack and relative wind affect pitch/yaw moment etc.  Relevant white papers/reading material would be cool

I tried to switch from Vim to Emacs twice in the last years, but I gave up twice. I tried again a month ago and I'm still using Emacs daily.<br/><br/>The reason is Emacs Lisp. Last year (motivated by lainchan) I started learning Common Lisp and liked it a lot. Then I found I can do whatever I want to do in Emacs Lisp. I've already written lots of functions. Maybe I can develop a new killer major mode, who knows.<br/><br/>Please share your experiences and thoughts about Elisp in this thread. Can/should I use it as an application framework for something not related to text editing?                                                </div>

                     Which fields are best for being a developer that just wants to minimise human interaction?<br/><br/>I have been learning for years, and have a masters, but I still have never managed to apply for a job. This is because I don't think I can handle working IRL with people; I will hate it due to social anxiety and my general desire to be alone.<br/><br/>Even remote work can be fraught with video chats etc. I understand nothing may be perfect.<br/><br/>What is the best field to pursue? If I have to, i'll spend a few years working on it to prove that I'm competent, although I don't want to rely on becoming genius-level at something.<br/><br/>I have a background in mathematics, physics, AI but it seems fairly useless

                     I used to think I was not that good at programming (and to some extent still feel this way). However, after going to meetups/hackerspaces and reading up on things online, I honestly don't feel as bad. Can I improve? Yes. However realizing how fuarrrked up things are (like storing all correspondence in a single multi terrabyte HDD) or hearing about some of the soykaf that companies like Microsoft pull, or Zuck calling vairables a, b, c , etc. , I feel like my code is not as bad. They could definitely improve in terms of quality, but the more I look around, the more it is a bit better to be a hobbyist or make commercial projects on my own.

                     I mean writing code where all the non reserved words are not in english.<br/>I found this blogpost in spanish:<br/><a href="https://albertcapdevila.net/programar-ingles-vs-espanol/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://albertcapdevila.net/programar-ingles-vs-espanol/</a><br/>Coding in your mother tongue makes the code more legible but there are many words that do not have an exact translation and one will struggle to find proper equivalents since there are no standards for them.<br/>So I want to ask the non anglo lains:<br/>Do you code in english or your mother tongue? And if you do what challenges have you came across?

                     This is new /λ/, also addressable as /lambda/, the programming board.  The intent is that this board will be used to share and discuss programs that have been made, for techniques and tools to be written of, and so other programming topics can be debated.<br/><br/>This is not the board to recruit programmers for projects.  If you have a project you want to discuss, have a good bit finished beforehand.<br/><br/>Relevancy is considered very important in this board.  It is expected that every image and file will be strictly relevant to programming.<br/><br/>Use tags for submitting programs inline with your post.  To use code tags, use the [code]...[/code] syntax.  To upload a program as a file, append .txt to the filename first.  Don't use an external service to upload a program of yours, unless it can't reasonably be avoided.<br/><br/>Hack deftly; document creatively; crack happily.  Debug carefully; backup often.
