       <div class="body">Idk where I shoud post it but...<br>My life and mental state are just falling apart right now.<br>For 
          two years now, I have not been able to move away from my past relationships, in which, as I thought, we were both happy. We invested 
          money in each other. It would seem that what could be better than a feeling of reciprocity?<br>It can be better when you are not being deceived. For six months, she told me how much she loved me, smiled in my face, but everything was a lie. They were just blatantly 
          lying to my face.<br>We spent almost every day together. I got along very well with her family, constantly stayed with them for overnight stays. We never bothered each other, we always had something to talk about.<br>But in the end, I was abruptly abandoned, she said that we are different.<br>Everything would be fine if I had already forgotten about this person, but the warm feelings that I experienced can not get out of my head in any way and continue to cause me pain.<br>Several times every six months I see her in my dreams, beautiful dreams from which I do not want to wake up, dreams in which we are happy together.<br>These dreams are the hardest to see. Sometimes I forget about it for a few months, and it seems that this is the end of rehabilitation. But dreams bring everything back 
          to the beginning.<br>My studies will start soon, it also puts a lot of pressure on me.<br>Sometimes at night I am concretely covered 
          and I can not get rid of anxiety in any way.<br>I'm afraid that all these factors will just take and strangle me.<br>I tried to talk 
          about this situation with my loved ones, but each time I was ignored.<br>Tell me how you are coping with the breakup, how you leave the past in the past and move on, because so far I am not able to come to this on my own. How to deal with all this in general...

Felt like we did everything together, told her everything about me, and then she wants to break up out of the blue. Honestly thought I was going to marry her. The best part is that I used to have dreams after the breakup of her cheating on me with some other guy.<br><br>That was early 2020. I could 
             try and figure out why she left me, but it's such a waste of time when I look back on it.  I've become such a different person to the point where people don't recognize me, mentally and physically.<br><br>As <a onclick="highlightReply('49288', event);" href="/hum/res/49278.html#49288">&gt;&gt;49288</a> said, pick up healthy habits. Start with running, or lifting at the gym. Something about exercise and the chemicals it releases help you focus deeper. Find ways to be better than the person you were yesterday. The biggest mistake is to do nothing as time passes by.
