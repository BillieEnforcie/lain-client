      <div class="body">Idk where I shoud post it but...<br>My life and mental state are just falling apart right now.<br>For 
         two years now, I have not been able to move away from my past relationships, in which, as I thought, we were both happy. We invested 
         money in each other. It would seem that what could be better than a feeling of reciprocity?<br>It can be better when you are not being deceived. For six months, she told me how much she loved me, smiled in my face, but everything was a lie. They were just blatantly 
         lying to my face.<br>We spent almost every day together. I got along very well with her family, constantly stayed with them for overnight stays. We never bothered each other, we always had something to talk about.<br>But in the end, I was abruptly abandoned, she said that we are different.<br>Everything would be fine if I had already forgotten about this person, but the warm feelings that I experienced can not get out of my head in any way and continue to cause me pain.<br>Several times every six months I see her in my dreams, beautiful dreams from which I do not want to wake up, dreams in which we are happy together.<br>These dreams are the hardest to see. Sometimes I forget about it for a few months, and it seems that this is the end of rehabilitation. But dreams bring everything back 
         to the beginning.<br>My studies will start soon, it also puts a lot of pressure on me.<br>Sometimes at night I am concretely covered 
         and I can not get rid of anxiety in any way.<br>I'm afraid that all these factors will just take and strangle me.<br>I tried to talk 
         about this situation with my loved ones, but each time I was ignored.<br>Tell me how you are coping with the breakup, how you leave the past in the past and move on, because so far I am not able to come to this on my own. How to deal with all this in general...

Felt like we did everything together, told her everything about me, and then she wants to break up out of the blue. Honestly thought I was going to marry her. The best part is that I used to have dreams after the breakup of her cheating on me with some other guy.<br><br>That was early 2020. I could 
            try and figure out why she left me, but it's such a waste of time when I look back on it.  I've become such a different person to the point where people don't recognize me, mentally and physically.<br><br>As <a onclick="highlightReply('49288', event);" href="/hum/res/49278.html#49288">&gt;&gt;49288</a> said, pick up healthy habits. Start with running, or lifting at the gym. Something about exercise and the chemicals it releases help you focus deeper. Find ways to be better than the person you were yesterday. The biggest mistake is to do nothing as time passes by.

      <div class="body">I just got this nice notebook, blank unlined white pages.<br>I couldn't resist but to puke in it all my schizophrenic rants, poems, 
         deep thoughts, runic drawings, actual technical drawings, short stories in different languages, long prosaic writings about how I feel in certain moments or about certain things, etc.<br>It's looking very messy but beautiful. If someone were to read it they might get a syncope.<br>Is there a more efficient way of writing for mental clarity? I don't like journaling about the things I do daily, my 
         life is utterly banal and common; and I already do a lot of introspection, expressing and rationalizing my emotions.

         <div class="body" style="clear:both">I can share a few things. Here's a set of German songs by a Schuler, a waltz called Seaman's Los and Winterblumen. I've midi'd the one but not the other. There are some blank staff papers with Militaire written on them or something but I have nothing written that deserves it. A mess of books I picked up from Bath, the artificial limb book was costly and I have preserved it poorly. Note from chem 
            book: "How swift the time has flown away; Since I first knew thee -- to this day; The schoolboy days are gone + past; The tie of friendship holds us fast."<br>I have a stack of nice papers with the intent of calligraphy, but I use them for rolling filters.

      <div class="body">I'm working as a backend developer in a large project since 3+ years, I have a colleague who is a Sr backend developer, but I have more skills, especially in this platform that i'm from scratch.<br><br>We are doing code review, each feature we do, we create a PR, and the other aprove it. Yesterday she asked me for aprove a PR quicly, a bugfix, becouse a frontend developer was blocked by the 
         issue. I aprove and merge it  without check.<br><br>At the nigth (outside working hours), I catch up with some PR from she and other 
         developer I have in charge. And I realised she made a mistake with a bitfield check.<br><br>I was going to revert the merge and ask for changes, but I decided not do it because the frontend developer needed the patch and I would not block him, so I write an issue and patch the code. <br><br>Today I recive a message from she like "i didn't like what you did ". After several meets, I call to her for ask why she writed me that.<br><br>Acording she, I was wrong touching "her code", she accused me for get into her job and make her 
         looks bad. I told her that she was mistaking my intentions but she continue saying that I made her look like an asshole and I only wanted the credit by the commit.<br><br>I told her that I did not know what to say to her, and that I could not empathize with her because I did not understand what was wrong.<br><br>In theory i run the backend development of the project, but my inefficiency in dealing with humans stress me.<br><br>Do you think I was really wrong? am i missing something?

         <div class="body" >Your intentions were coming from right place but the way you went about things is a little bit off. Take the analogy to anything else IRL and you would be really "touching someones elses code". A bit trivial non issue when people collaborate together on code but I guess people that focus exclusively on innanimate objects for long periods of time lose that "human touch". <br><br>Ask yourself, are you on good terms with this person? Is there any animosity between you two for any reason? Have they helped you before in similar manner? Is there a constructive equal talk of code issues between you two or is it more of boss/underling dynamic? Be honest.<br><br>If answers to the questions above aren't satisfactory then you should either motivate a more productive communication based on issue resolvement and personal respect. If you for instance just messaged the colleague "hey just went over PR 
            and seems I missed a bug, do you want me to fix it or would you?". Or, if you don't want to, either way just apologise and keep distance. Leave their issues to themselves and see eventually how the company falls apart.

You may have been trying to make the project the best that it could be, but because you went in and

So now her boss is gonna think she's a soykaf coder and won't give her a raise or promotion or whatever the hell. What you should've done instead is told them about the bug and said you had a fix for it, then tell them that a bunch of her other commits have bugs in them that you have patches for, and say that if they don't want you to patch their soykaf they should have epic hot sex with you. <br><br>That's what I did at my old job anyways.

"it's okay, even if it was rushed, nothing bad's going to happen". "just look at the flu shots, aren't those great!". I found that offensive. You seem to have read the same reply differently, in that it's a critique of the common statement: "this vaccine was rushed". I'll tackle your reading<br><br>A short development cycle can imply two things. As you mentioned, it implies that the medicine is up-to-date, and targets the current virus. however it also implies no long term study. It lacks long term proof of effectiveness and safety. Then, I agree that "rushed" does not necessarily mean unsafe, but it can mean "not proven to be safe". in context of the medical world, we ought to see these two definitions as interchangeable.<br><br>Pfizer stopped their trials after 6 months and vaccinated their control group, rendering potential future analyses impossible to make. Taking that into account, I think the phrase "they were rushed" reflects reality, but I digress it might be more poignant to emphasis the underlying implication that no long term study was made. in that vein, the more scandalous part is (not they they were rushed, but) that we know that they don't stop transmission, and do lose efficacy much faster than promised.</div>

            it's back to the basics.<br>1. You need to ensure proper nutrition and hydration.<br>That means 3L of water a day, a variety of foods; bananas, green soykaf (lettuce, asparagus, broccoli), red soykaf (tomatoes, beetroot, apples). You have to ensure you're getting vitamin C which you cannot get from meat.<br>Speaking of which, cut out processed meat it's not healthy and there are numerous studies 
            indicating a correlation with cancers. Balance your meat intake: fish is good (mind the plastic: avoid ocean fish if you can, like salmon or tuna) beef is very nutrient rich, but expensive. If you're tight on cash get chicken. Once again avoiding processed soykaf - 
            yes that means pre-packaged dishes. Learn to cook based.cooking is a good start. Notice how I'm not focusing on what not to eat? <br>2. Focus on something, anything. <br>When you focus on what *not* to do, you box yourself into this state of constantly being aware of what you're not doing right. Instead, focus on what you should be doing. Make that the present. It's positive metal reinforcement; 
            a la psycho-cybernetics. This is how you get bogged down in depression. You need to pave the way with autonomy. Which bring us to no. 3.<br>3. Goal setting.<br>Goals are the quintessential part of self-help. Every morning, set yourself a list of goals. A minimum of 
            3 for each category; Body, Finance, Bucket List, Career, Relationship. Write them down, physically. Typing them in a .txt in ~ won't 
            do you any good. Make it one of your goals to write down your goals EVERY morning if that helps.<br>4. The Morning<br>Human sleep cycles range follow the Circadian rhythm. That means sun goes down, you go down, sun comes up, you get up. Adjust your sleep schedule to accommodate that. You need to be up either just before or at sunrise. This is the fundamental discipline building exercise. If as soon as you wake up you get out of bed, that discipline carrys you through the day. It'll take about a week of hell if your sleep cycle is really fuarrked to fix it so be prepared. You'll need to accommodate this new waking time with a bedtime to maintain a fixed minimum no. of hours of sleep. If you're young, &lt;26 then get 9 hours of sleep, minimum. If your sleep patterns begin to gradually filter down to 8 or even 7, just accept that and utilize those extra hours to your benefit. I find I personally naturally gravitate to bi-phasic  sleep. Once you've established a sleep pattern, try taking a siesta. (Sleep for a few hours at around 13:00.) You'll gain an acute alertness and a boost of energy into the evening.<br>5. Walk.<br>As soon as you wake up. Walk. 15 minute walk, up the road and back. While you walk think about all the things you have to be grateful for. Observe nature, admire it. When you get back have breakfast and write down your goals.<br>6. Dig straight into it.<br>This is the nitty gritty. You have your goals. You have direction. The next step is the hardest: action. By far, the best technique for coping with this is the Pomodoro technique. It breaks the idea of a task into bite-sized blocks of time, however if you have any other strategies, do use them. You're also free from distraction at this time of the morning, it's where the best work is done. I also suggest that you avoid all forms of media during this time.

Read Mortimer Adler's book "How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading". He basically argues that other books should be read faster, while some books require (or even deserve) a slower and more throughout/careful reading. He also defines multiple levels of reading. See ch. 2 re. levels of reading and pp.38 onward on reading speed ("it is true enough that many people read some things too slowly, and that they ought to read them faster. But many people also read some things too fast...") Also don't make marking/notes on the first time you read a section.

He turned out fine, one of my best acid trips ever was going out to the woods with him.<br><br>Second guy I don't know so well, he asked for a 300+ ug dose his second or third time. I heard secondhand what happened: he started shouting about random women he knew (or didn't know) and should have fuarrrked. Then eventually he pissed his pants and some friends had to change his underwear for him while he stood around looking like a fool. Afterwards he told me he had a spiritual experience XD

      <div class="body">I've been meaning to do this post on Lainchan for a while now, but the timing never quite seemed to hit the mark. During the construction of the site/ideology I ended up adopting the idea of putting something, anything out, regardless of it being finished or not, so as to keep myself active and moving regarding the development of the site/ideology. <br><br>I think I'm currently in a situation where outsider comments would have their weight in gold - that is to say: I think my writing and/or programming skills (if you could call them that) are, or have become, so unclear and/or obscure that I could use a nudge in the right direction, for I suspect the point of it all isn't being conveyed to the "general public" (can't say if Neocities is quite that, but still...) in the most optimal manner possible.<br><br>What I want you, lainons, to do, if you could spare a few minutes of your time, is questioning,criticizing/judging/evaluating my site and its contenst to 
         the best of your knowledge. Point out all the contradictions of the ideology, stupid coding choices as well as the general feelings or "vibes" (be it good or bad) that you get from or spot on the site.<br><br>To put it briefly, the whole point of it all is to achieve a qualitative change of life, to assert a "point" to the sickly, broken people that wander around the surface of Earth. "Towards what end?", you might ask. Simply put: towards a more fulfilling (i.e. more individuated) life - the kind of life that the Spectacle promises, but cannot and will not deliver to us. I'm no authority on the subject - in fact, you might even say that I'm writing it all 
         more for myself in order to combat the attitude that resides in me, and which prefers to wallow in lazy, apathetic comfort instead of aiming for the stars - but I think it is an important project (despite my somewhat obvious shortcomings in English). <br><br>My site is located in: <a href="https://neocities.org/site/a-com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://neocities.org/site/a-com</a>.<br><br>I'm not sure if this thread fits in on this /hum/, but I made sure that I didn't kill anything too important with my thread. And, if you must know, the killed-off thread's OP was:<br>"Are you involves with the Knights? (serious)<br><span class="quote">&gt;in;b4 the knights are fictional</span><br>You don't get it"

I realize that suffering is an integral part of the human condition, but I think there are two kinds of sufferings to go along with it. The first one being the kind that makes you strong, and the second one that's all just suffering. If you're willing 
            to struggle for something greater than yourself, somethin that fulfills yourself, then you can overcome the second kind, but unless you don't have something like that to back you up, to "ground" yourself, it's all just pointless suffering all the way. No amount of "self-help" will do you any good, when you're missing the obvious, namely being satisfied with yourself. If you don't want to prove yourself to your parents, friends, your grandmother, grandpa, me, your relatives, co-workers or complete utter strangers on the bus, then prove it to yourself. You are a god in your own game, so do whatever it takes to ascend your people to the next level on the chain of evolution, because we're all in the same boat, and harming your fellow man is equivalent to harming your self. <br><br>Ascend or 
            die, those are the only options.

It wouldn't be much of an "international" if I were to use only one language now would it?. The concept of multilingualism is already in place as a html structure in here (<a href="https://a-com.neocities.org/footnotes0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://a-com.neocities.org/footnotes0.html</a>), if you only bothered to move past your preconceived notions and look further. I'm going to expand it to other webpages as well once I've fleshed out the core concepts of the ideology. <br>Also, the psychological processes of individuation and self-actualization are an existential imperative irrespective of your race, nationality or gender, even if the plague of comallodianism is mostly restricted to the developed nations, so 
            these nazi claims of yours are simply unfounded - blinded nationalism and invdividual growth do not exactly go hand in hand, in case 
            you aren't familiar with the historical examples of totalitarian remiges from the 20th-century. I suspect that it wasn't so much the 
            language as it was the aesthetic that triggered your nazi radar, which is for a good reason: the used color combination is very reminiscent of the one utilized by the nazis, with their emphasis on the color red, which for many cultures (not all) stands for vitality, power, courage, danger and/or passion (in sum, a feeling of intensity). These properties are what we're after in anti-comallodianism, because wallowing in lazy comfort and the life of intensity are mutually exclusive conditions, and opting for the latter is always 
            superior to the former.

      <div class="body">Anyone else 
         really into fingernail and toe care? Ever since I started reading up some books by Julius Evola and GNOMEos I've been really interested in feet, specifically the toes and the toenail regarding the natural flora and fauna of the toenail ecosystem. It's just really interesting how an incredibly varied amount of multicellular organisms each with different roles in the toe ecosystem exist in just one angstrom of a toenail. Specifically the underside of course, it's the nicest and the cutest.

Your response made my think about this and ended up hiring a podriatist to come and fix my issue. She ended up removing the part that was ingrown (It was pretty big, I never imagined) and it turns out I had pieces from a long time buried into the skin, that were causing pain.<br><br>The procedure wasn't that paiful, the most painful part was the anesthesia. It was good to 
            know I had no other issues, just that one ingrown nail.

            news for me friend. Lost all my toes they turned black and rotten because I spent too much time frotting about in the snow shoeless because I liked the feeling of ice between my toes. Be thankful for what you have my young grasshopper.
